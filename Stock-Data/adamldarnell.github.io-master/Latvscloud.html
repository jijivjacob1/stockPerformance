            <p>This scatterplot does not really yiled and conclusive data. Though one could gather that you are far less likely to have cloudy weather when directly on the equators axis. This is also a good example to show that some data just does not translate well to being visualized. As an onlooker it is hard to gather any conclusions from this spread. </p>
